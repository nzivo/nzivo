### Hi there, I am [John Nzivo](https://twitter.com/johnnnzivo) a fullstack developer 👋

##### I currently live and work in [Nairobi, Kenya](https://magicalkenya.com/tembeakenya/)

I have a good grasp in vanilla Javascript and two of it's popular frameworks, React Js and Vue Js.

Recently I have been learning the fastapi by [Tiangolo](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to build my backend and I find fascinating to work with.

🤔 I’m looking for help with microservices based on docker and done in fastapi, any help will go a long way
